Have Fun 
If you want me to remove your game site, I will happily remove it but I do give credit. This is just connecting all of your great sites. Please notify me if you want it removed. Please allow pop-ups on this site. Here's how: Go to chrome settings, go to privacy and security, click "site settings", click "popups and redirects" and then click "sites can send popups and use redirects".
This Is A Clone Of Dacoder12.github.io for an alternative if it gets blocked. I am the same person logged in on an alt.
